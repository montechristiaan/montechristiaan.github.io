# Friend Finder App

## Description

*Friend Finder* matches you with a friend based on your responses to a ten question survey. The friend is chosen from existing user record in the data folder who matches your answers the closest. 

*Friend Finder* was created using a Node.js and Express server. 

## Demo
	
*Friend Finder* is deployed to Heroku. Please check it out [here](https://csimmonsfriendfinder.herokuapp.com/).

## Running the App

To run the app locally and access it in your browser, you will first need to clone the repo, install the dependencies, and then set up the `PORT` variable to one of your choosing. My app used 3000.
	
Once that's set up, run "node server.js" in the terminal and the app will now be running locally on your chosen `PORT`. You can then access it from your browser at the URL `localhost:PORT`, or in my case it was `localhost:3000`.
